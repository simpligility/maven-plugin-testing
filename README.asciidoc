== Maven Plugin Testing

This project is a temporary for of the the Maven Plugin Testing module from http://maven.apache.org/plugin-testing/. 

It just releases the project as of svn revision 1534908 from http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/plugin-testing/trunk
which includes support for Maven 3.1.1, but has not been released yet.

This is necessary since the Android Maven Plugin needs Maven 3.1.1 support and requires this project.

The only change will be the groupId's being moved into com.simpligility.*
