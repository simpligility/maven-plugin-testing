Maven Plugin Testing Harness

 The Maven Plugin Testing Harness provides mechanisms to manage tests on Mojos, i.e. by pre-constructing the
 {{{http://plexus.codehaus.org}Plexus}} components, providing stub objects for Maven functionality such as projects,
 and populating fields from an XML file that resembles the plugin configuration in the POM.

 The best way to start is to read the cookbook {{{./getting-started/index.html}How to use Maven Plugin Testing Harness}}.

* Examples

   The following examples shows how to use the Testing Harness in more advanced usecases:

   * {{{./examples/complex-mojo-parameters.html}Testing Complex Mojo Parameters}}

   * {{{./examples/multiproject.html}Testing Multiproject}}

   * {{{./examples/repositories.html}Testing Using Repositories}}

   * {{{./examples/artifact.html}Testing Project Artifact}}
